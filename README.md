# SOC-Automation-Project

## Objective
The SOC Automation Project was developed to create a functional Security Operations Center (SOC) environment capable of automatically detecting, analyzing, and responding to security threats. By integrating open-source tools like Wazuh (SIEM and XDR), The Hive (case management), and Shuffle (SOAR for workflow automation), this project demonstrates how security processes can be streamlined to improve incident response times, reduce manual workload, and ensure a more resilient security
posture.

The automation workflows designed in this project enable the SOC to handle threats in realtime, leveraging integration between various components to detect and respond to suspicious activities effectively. This documentation provides a breakdown of the project setup, configuration steps, testing processes, and key insights for anyone looking to build a similar automated SOC environment.
